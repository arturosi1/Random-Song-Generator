# Random-Song-Generator
Generates random song or artist

# About the program:
This program is a simple random song generator as well as a random artist generator that uses Java, Java AWT and Swing. This program was created since I usually would struggle to find a good song to listen to that I would enjoy. This program reads 2 different files and inputs each line into a string ararylist. So when you click the random button for either song or artist, it then generates a random number from 0 to the length of the arraylist and then will output the string found in the random number index on the arraylist.

# How to run:
Before running the program, you must first make sure you have 2 txt files, one labeled Songs.txt and the other Artist.txt. Make sure both of these files are in the same directory as the program files. You run the run.sh file by typing "sh run.sh" in a terminal within the directory.
